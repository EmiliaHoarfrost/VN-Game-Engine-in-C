# VN-Game-Engine-in-C
Prototyped a VN game engine in C (as a beginner)
Since it is terminal-based, it allows you to use ASCII art for your sprite needs, which has a great retro feel

You can add colors in the terminal output by using stuff like "\x1b[31m"
I think they're called escape code sequences?
